Contributing
============

Contributions to this project are very welcome.

## Submitting changes

Changes can be submitted as “pull requests” on the project [github repository](https://github.com/jnqnfe/pulse-binding-rust).

## Licensing

Understand that the set of files that form this project are published under a specific licensing
model, the purpose of which is to define the rights of use and to protect the project and its
developers. When changes to this set of files are submitted, naturally and as is typical, it will be
assumed that you accept your changes being licensed under that licensing model.

If the existing licensing is somehow insufficient and you wish for an alternate arrangement, you
must make this very clear, and it would be wise to ask in advance before investing effort into a
change which may be rejected on this basis.

Implicit or explicit acceptance of changes being incorporated under the licensing model of the
project does not imply consent for your changes to later be re-licensed under a different license
at the sole discretion of project owner(s).
