## Copyright & Licensing

Protecting the rights of users, developers, and contributors alike is important. As is typical for
projects like this, the work produced by this project is protected by copyright law and is made
available under specific licensing terms and conditions that define and protect the rights of all of
the afore mentioned groups of individuals. The details of the current licensing model can be found
in the project `README.md` file, should you wish to review what model exactly is in use.

When considering contributing, you must understand that unless you explicitly state otherwise, any
contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0
license, shall be dual licensed as described in the project `README.md` file, without any additional
terms or conditions.

Please understand that when submitting a contribution, if you insist upon different licensing, this
will likely make it impossible for your contribution to be accepted. You are encouraged to ask in
advance if you are considering doing this.

You should understand that you are the copyright holder of your contributions, although not all
contributions (for instance typo fixes) meet the legal standard of being copyrightable work. For any
contributions that do meet the standard of being something copyrightable, the licensing itself
includes certain protections guarding your work from being re-licensed under different licensing
without your consent.

Note: Other projects may feel completely free to re-use and modify this text for their own purposes.
