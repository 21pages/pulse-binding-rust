Changes between 1.0.3 and 1.0.4:
---------------

 * Use explicit test script for Travis, rather than relying on default, to ensure that the `--all`
   flag is passed to `cargo test`, which I though was already done, but seems not from the logs and
   thus tests were not actually being done.

Changes between 1.0.2 and 1.0.3:
---------------

 * [pulse-binding] Added `From` methods for transmuting between certain introspection structs and
   their `sys` counterparts. (They are identical, and only duplicated in the binding to add
   documentation.

Changes between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2:
---------------

 * Added travis badge to individual crates

Changes between 1.0.0 and 1.0.1:
---------------

 * Fixed toml file license string "LGPL-2.1" => "LGPL-2.1+"
 * Fixed toml file missing author email address
 * Removed obsolete readme doc links

Version 1.0:
---------------

 * Original release
