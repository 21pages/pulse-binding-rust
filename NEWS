Changes between 1.0.4d and ???:
---------------

 [pulse-binding] (1.0.3 => ???)

 * Fixed infinite loop bug in Proplist::iterate. I mis-read the documentation, it's the return value
   from the C function call that will be NULL when it reaches the end of the list, not the state
   variable.
 * Fixed use of Proplist::iterate. The state tracking variable used for the underlying C function
   cannot be hidden within the iterate function, it causes an infinite loop of returning the first
   entry. I don't know wtf I was thinking. Calling this method now require providing a state
   tracking object.

Changes between 1.0.3 and 1.0.4d:
---------------

(no crate version changes, project only)

 * Use explicit test script for Travis, rather than relying on default, to ensure that the `--all`
   flag is passed to `cargo test`, which I thought was already done, but seems not from the logs and
   thus tests were not actually being done.
 * Fix Travis failures - add missing libpulse-mainloop-glib0 dependency to test environment.
 * Properly fix Travis tests - add pulseaudio dependency and get it started in test environment.

Changes between 1.0.2 and 1.0.3:
---------------

 [pulse-binding] (1.0.2 => 1.0.3)

 * Added `From` methods for transmuting between certain introspection structs and their `sys`
   counterparts. (They are identical, and only duplicated in the binding to add documentation).

Changes between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2:
---------------

 * Added travis badge to individual crates

Changes between 1.0.0 and 1.0.1:
---------------

 * Fixed toml file license string "LGPL-2.1" => "LGPL-2.1+"
 * Fixed toml file missing author email address
 * Removed obsolete readme doc links
