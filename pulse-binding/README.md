libpulse_binding
================

A Rust language binding for the PulseAudio libpulse library.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
libpulse-binding = { version = "2.0", features = "" }
```

and this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate libpulse_binding as pulse;
```

Finally, fill in the `features` attribute of the dependency added above with the right compatibility
flag (listed within this cratesâ€™ toml file) to disable functionality for versions of the PulseAudio
client library that are too new for you. (This compatibility layer targets the entire PA client C
API, and you will naturally encounter problems where mismatching version support with the version
of PA on your systems). See the overall project `COMPATIBILITY.md` file for further details.

## Licensing

This crate is primarily licensed under LGPL 2.1+ (per PulseAudio itself). Alternate MIT/Apache-2.0
licensing is available under certain circumstances. See the main project `README.md` file for
further details.
