A Rust language binding for the PulseAudio libpulse-simple library.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
libpulse-binding = { version = "2.0", features = "" }
libpulse-simple-binding = { version = "2.0", features = "" }
```

and this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate libpulse_binding as pulse;
extern crate libpulse_simple_binding as psimple;
```

Finally, fill in the `features` attribute of the dependencies added above with the right
compatibility flags (listed within the respective cratesâ€™ toml files) to disable functionality for
versions of the PulseAudio client library that are too new for you. (This compatibility layer
targets the entire PA client C API, and you will naturally encounter problems where mismatching
version support with the version of PA on your systems). See the overall project `COMPATIBILITY.md`
file for further details.
