Project/repo changelog.

This changelog previously covered all changes in this repository, but now each Rust crate has its
own specific changelog in its own subdirectory. This changelog covers general changes not suitable
for inclusion in those changelogs.

The version number specified here reflects that of the overall project, most closely related to the
primary `pulse-binding` crate (but is only updated here when there are changes to document here).
When the project was begun, a single common version number seemed to be the most logical thing to
have, with no expectation that so much work would end up being done and that version numbers of the
binding/sys crates would diverge so much. Tagging was done based on this, and later continued to
be done based on the primary `pulse-binding` crate. I am aware that this is an unfortunate potential
source of confusion now.

# 2.2.4 (October 8th, 2018)

 * Travis: Simplified and now avoids sudo
 * Workspace: Simplified - specification of an actual `[package]` section it turns out is redundant
   alongside a `[workspace]` section.
 * Split the changelog file into separate changelogs for each crate and this one for the overall
   project for greater clarity. The overall project version number with associated git tags is still
   a potential source of confusion however.

Note, intermediate version numbers were crate specific only

# 2.1 (July 17th, 2018)

 * Renamed `NEWS` file to `CHANGELOG.md` and reformatted to markdown

# 2.0.1 (June 26th, 2018)

 * Updated copy of C includes from PA (version 11.0 â†’ 12.0)

Note, intermediate version numbers were crate specific only

# 1.2 (June 1st, 2018)

 * Further licensing clarification

# 1.0.4d (February 15th, 2018)

 * Fixed Travis testing. Tests were not actually being run, giving a misleading positive result, and
   fixing that then highlighted problems with the test environment which took a few iterations to
   resolve (hence the 'd' in the version number from premature assumptions of resolving the
   problem).
    - Fixed tests not actually being run. I had incorrectly presumed that tests for all sub-crate
      dependencies of the workspace crate would be run automatically, but reviewing the logs
      highlighted that this was not the case; an explicit test script passing the `--all` flag to
      `cargo test` was needed.
    - Added missing `libpulse-mainloop-glib0` library to test environment
    - Actually added `pulseaudio` to the test environment and added command to start it

# 1.0 (January 24th, 2018)

 * Original release
