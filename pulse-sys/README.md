libpulse_sys
============

A Rust language linking library for the PulseAudio libpulse library. See also the higher-level
`libpulse_binding` crate.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
libpulse-sys = { version = "1.0", features = "" }
```

and this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate libpulse_sys as pulse;
```

Finally, fill in the `features` attribute of the dependency added above with the right compatibility
flag (listed within this cratesâ€™ toml file) to disable functionality for versions of the PulseAudio
client library that are too new for you. (This crate targets the entire PA client C API, and you
will naturally encounter problems where mismatching version support with the version of PA on your
systems). See the overall project `COMPATIBILITY.md` file for further details.
